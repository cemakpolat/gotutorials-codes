Create a command-line tool that fetches and displays weather information for a given location using a public weather API like OpenWeatherMap.

For simplicity, Open-Meteo is a great choice since it doesn’t require an API key. Here’s an example of how you could implement a Go CLI tool to fetch weather data:

```
    go mod init wapi
    go mod tidy
    go run .
```
